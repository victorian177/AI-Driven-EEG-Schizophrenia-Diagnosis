        # Data Collection Report
        Here is the Data Collection Report for the project on the "Early Detection of Schizophrenia using EEG Data." This report provides a detailed account of the collection process for EEG data obtained from individuals both with and without schizophrenia, categorized as patients and controls, respectively. The purpose of this report is to elucidate the methodologies employed in data collection, participant demographics, and essential characteristics of the collected EEG data.

        ## Scope of the Report
        1. **Participants:** A detailed overview of the individuals involved in the study, including patients diagnosed with schizophrenia and the control group.
        2. **Data Collection Methodology:** An in-depth explanation of the procedures, tools, and protocols utilized for gathering EEG data.
        3. **Data Distributions:** Presentation and analysis of various distributions within the collected data, highlighting patterns and differences between patient and control groups.

        The insights derived from this comprehensive data collection process are pivotal for the subsequent stages of our project, contributing to the development of a machine learning model for the early detection of schizophrenia.
